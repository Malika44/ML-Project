m/0814255,Diva Velez,False,TheDivaReview.com,Rotten,2.5/5,2010-02-12,The Lightning Thief is all crass ineptitude and lost potential. Columbus' infantilizing of any character depth and use of leftover Harry Potter special effects will amuse only the smallest in your pantheon.
m/0814255,Christopher Smith,False,Bangor Daily News (Maine),Rotten,C,2010-02-12,"The plot is a pretty blatant rehash of the typical ""coming-of-age hero"" tropes.

m/0814255,Brian Orndorf,False,BrianOrndorf.com,Rotten,C,2010-02-12,"A clunky kid-sized epic, able to conjure colossal acts of Greek myth wonderment, but never brave enough to shut its pie hole and let the audience process the screen magic."
